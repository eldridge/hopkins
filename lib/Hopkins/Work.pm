Hopkins::Work - task queued as a unit of work

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Hopkins::Work represents an instance of a task.  in other
words, it is a task that has been queued as a unit of work
ready for execution.  it is eventually associated with a
database object by the store session, but can and will live
on its own without database connectivity.
